A collection of stylish, dark-themed HTML defacement-inspired pages 🖥️ with glitch effects ⚡, matrix rain 🌧️, CRT scans 📺, custom cursors 🖱️, and hacker aesthetics 😎. Purely frontend designs — no backend or malicious code 🚫.
These pages are created for **educational and design showcase purposes only** 🎨, demonstrating creative UI/UX techniques using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (glitch animations, typing effects, matrix rain, custom cursors, etc.).
